//BufferedReader : we can use bR  to read to char data from the file
//the main advantage of bufferedREader whennn compared with filereader is we can read data line by line in addition to char by char
//Constructors: BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(Reader r);
//BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(Reader r,int buffersize);
//Note : BufferedReader can't communicaate directly with the file and it can communicaate via some reader object
//methods 
// int read()
// int readd(char[] ch)
//void close()
//String readLine() -> it attemps to read nextLine from file and return it. if the nextLine not available then this method returns null
