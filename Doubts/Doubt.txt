class Doubt{
	int x = 10;
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		//I cant access x without creating object because x is an instance variable which means it can get memory only when object will be created
		//System.out.println(x);
		
		Doubt d = new Doubt();
		// now memory is allocted to x variable so now u can access
		System.out.println(d.x);
		//but cant access directly by using variable name inside static method
		//x variable is instance variable which means its value vary from object to object
		//let say we create two objects
		// Doubt g = new Doubt();
		//Doubt h = new Doubt();
		
		so now if we print directly whats happens 
		System.out.println(x);
		it get confuse which value of "x" to choose form g or h 
		thats we have to use reference to access the variable.
